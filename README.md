  <p align="center">
A project which implements a mock checkout page for buying tickets to a show using React as a frontend library. With Ticket Haul, users can select a show from a list of upcoming shows, select the quantity, enter their basic billing information, and see their final cost with fees before checking out. Credit card data is not processed at the moment but the project simulates how the payment process would actually work in real life.

Users have the ability to select a show from a list of upcoming shows, select the quantity, and enter their basic billing information and finally see the final cost with fees before checking out.

## Testing

Once the project is set up locally and the local development server is up and running, the project can be tested in the following fashion:

* The homepage lists upcoming shows and the user can select one or more shows and adjust the quantity/number of tickets for each show. 

* The user will not be able to go to view what's in the cart until they add at least 1 ticket to the cart. Attempting to do so, will alert a message to inform them that they should add to cart before viewing the checkout page.

* Once, the cart is no longer empty, a user can then view what's in the cart by clicking at the cart icon at the top right icon in navigation. 

* A checkout page will display information about ticket(s) bought the user will have to provide the billing information and accept terms before placing an order.

* Once the button to place order is no longer disabled, a user can then click and will see a loading message followed by the success message if the order was successful!

## Credit Card Testing

To test for valid card numbers, the user should consider using either of the following:

* User's own real credit card information (Card number, expiration date, and CVC)

* One of the testing numbers exposed by relevant companies. See the list below:

| Brand | Number            | CVC           | Date              |
|-------|-------------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Visa  | 4242424242424242  | Any 3 digits  | Any future date   |
| Visa (debit)  | 4000056655665556  | Any 3 digits  | Any future date   |
